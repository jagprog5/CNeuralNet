# C Neural Network

* [Classifies the MNIST handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* Typical error rate of 7-8%
* 32 nodes in hidden layer
* Uses softmax activation on output nodes, and cross entropy loss function for training

Use the commands:
* `make run` to compile and run
* `make run_reduced` to compile and run with reduced output
* `make clean` will remove the object files and executable.
